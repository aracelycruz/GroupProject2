Load factor is a key metric used in the airline industry to indicate the percentage of a carrier's available seats that are filled with paying passengers. Because the costs of sending an aircraft into flight are relatively the same whether there are 50 people aboard or 100, airlines have a strong incentive to fill as many seats as possible by selling more tickets. Higher load factors mean that an airline's fixed costs are spread across a greater number of passengers, making the airline more profitable.


United Guidance and Stock Performance
United stated in its earnings release that bookings for spring travel and beyond "remain strong" despite continuing concerns around the COVID-19 pandemic. The airline plans to ramp up capacity throughout 2022 by ungrounding 52 Boeing 777 aircraft as demand returns. Still, United expects to fly fewer available seat miles (ASM) in 2022 compared to 2019. The airline predicts capacity for Q1 FY 2022 to be down 16% to 18% compared with Q1 FY 2019 and that 2022 capacity more broadly will be down relative to 2019. The company did not provide revenue guidance in the press release.
