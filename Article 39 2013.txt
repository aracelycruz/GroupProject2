United Airlines to drop Grand Forks from its route map


United Airlines will pull out of Grand Forks this winter, ending service to the North Dakota city only about a year after it began.

The carrier will discontinue its two daily United Express flights to Denver on Dec. 3, according to the Grand Forks Herald.

"The financial performance of the flights did not meet our expectations," United spokeswoman Mary Clark says in a statement quoted by the Herald. "We will contact customers currently booked on our flights between Grand Forks and Denver and offer to either re-accommodate them on other flights or provide a refund."

United's pullout comes as Grand Forks and airports across North Dakota have seen passenger numbers soar recently. Record or near-record passenger counts have been reported at a number of North Dakota airports. KXJB-TV notes boardings at Grand Forks airport are up 9% so far this year, putting it on pace for a possible record year in 2013.

The pullout will leave Grand Forks with two carriers: Delta and leisure-oriented Allegiant.

United began its most recent Grand Forks service in October 2012, with Grand Forks Airport Executive Director Patrick Dame saying the Denver route had been "the No. 1 goal of the Airport Authority for the past 20 years," according to the Herald.

"We worked hard to get them here," Grand Forks City Council President Hal Gershman adds to the Herald. "Again, with airlines, people need to understand it's 'use it or lose it.'"
