United Continental Holdings
, the parent company of United Airlines, reported first-quarter earnings Tuesday that beat Wall Street profit expectations but fell shy of revenue estimates, as the airline grapples with the prolonged grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max jets.

Here’s what the company reported versus what analysts polled by Refinitiv expected:

Adjusted earnings per share: $1.15 versus 95 cents expected.
Revenue: $9.59 billion versus $9.61 billion.
The carrier, which has 14 of Boeing’s 737 Max jets in its fleet, has grounded the aircraft through early July as Boeing rushes to fix a software problem suspected in two recent fatal crashes.
